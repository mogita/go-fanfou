**Please note that the library is at a very early stage of development.** Things could be changing at times. Breaking changes are expected, but I'll make it as less as possible. The stable versions will begin with the first [release](https://github.com/mogita/go-fanfou/releases) in the future.

## Usage

```
go get -u github.com/mogita/go-fanfou
```

package main

import "github.com/mogita/go-fanfou/fanfou"

func main() {
  // ...
}
```

Please refer to the `examples` folder for the basic usages of this library.
